# Session 1: Introduction

## A Common Thread

Ironically the subject of software design fundamentals is a broad and complex topic 
that would take hundreds of hours to exhaustively cover.  

Our goal in these sessions is to provide a foundation of understanding, and more
importantly, to create an awareness of some of the important introduce areas of
computer science in a way that is both practical and to the point.


## Outline

The agenda for this session will be as follows:

1. [Software Design Concerns](DesignConcerns.md):  We will first categorize the
    common problems that occur throughout the software development cycle and
    explain why you should care about them.

2. [Software Design Principles](DesignPrinciples.md):  This is a look at the overall
    software design principles that should guide the development process.

3. [Under the Hood](LowLevel.md):  This is a foundational look to help understand
    compilers and interpreters.  It sets up basic understanding that will help us
    navigate other topics throughout the upcoming sessions.
